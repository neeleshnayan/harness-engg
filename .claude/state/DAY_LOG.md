# DAY LOG — the chair's daily record, for the Fable chair to review

**Created 2026-08-21 on the CEO's instruction: *"I also think you should
maintain a day log for fable to review."***

## What this is, and how it differs from what already exists

- **`CTO_REVIEW_QUEUE.md`** is organised by ACTION — one entry per Tier-2 act
  or Tier-3 deferral, written for audit. It has grown large and it answers
  *"what did the co-CTO do, and was it inside its charter?"*
- **`docs/archives/`** is Donna's, written for the CEO, and it answers *"what
  happened at this firm today?"*
- **THIS FILE answers a third question, and it is the one a returning chair
  actually asks: "what is DIFFERENT since I left, what is MINE to decide, and
  what is on fire?"** Chronological, newest day at the top, ruthlessly short.

**The rules for keeping it, so it stays useful:**

1. **One entry per UTC day. Date it by UTC** — the local day rolls over 5.5
   hours early in this timezone and has already caused one dating error.
2. **Newest at the top.** A returning chair reads down until it recognises
   the world.
3. **Every entry carries the same five headings**, and a heading with nothing
   under it is deleted, not padded: **DECIDED · BUILT · MEASURED · OPEN FOR
   FABLE · ON FIRE**.
4. **"On fire" means dated or losing money.** Nothing else goes there. If it
   is merely important, it is OPEN.
5. **Link, do not duplicate.** Point at the artifact, the request id, the
   queue entry. This file is an index with judgement, not a second copy of
   the record.
6. **Write it as the day happens, not at end of day.** The end-of-day version
   is a memoir; the live version is a handover.

### ON FIRE

**Auto-approval envelope v3 will short the fund on 2026-09-08.** The TLT and
DBC time exits fire that day (`ExitRuleSet` seq 178, 181), auto-approve, and
sell shares the broker holds **zero** of. The riskofficer rebuilt the real
evaluation context and ran it: **all four live exits pass v3 twelve checks out
of twelve, zero failures.** $652.09 date-certain, $750.36 armed across all four
legs — 39.79% of NAV. Shorting is enabled on the account; borrow cost, buy-in
risk and unbounded loss are all unmodelled here.

The envelope is not malfunctioning. Every check it makes is true. **It checks
our own book and never asks the broker what it holds.**

**Status**: v4 is fully specified (`docs/R19_ENVELOPE_V4_SPEC_2026-08-21.md`),
**CEO-approved**, and the CEO has now **authorised this chair to cross the
Tier-3 line to get it done** — with the condition that Fable receives full
context. Execution plan is builder-in-worktree → **adversary blind** →
chair merges on green only. Not hand-written by the chair.

**It must ship WITH the skip-visibility fix.** A v4 decline currently produces
no event, no log line and no alarm; the proposal then expires at 120 minutes
and **never re-raises**. `pipeline.py:400-403` and `fund.py:3768` both claim it
does; both are false (`exitrule.py:275` skips on `triggered_at`). **v4 alone
converts a silent short into a silently dropped exit.**

**And the one that gates any future short**: `riskmonitor.py:878` computes P&L
with no reference to the sign of the position, and `positions.py:87` leaves a
short holding its long cost basis. **On a short, a rising price is a loss that
reads as a gain — stops fire backwards.** Filed `34338ef6`. R19 does not touch
it.

### DECIDED (by the CEO)

- **Envelope v4 adopted**, with the skip-visibility fix in the same change.
- **Two agents may run in parallel when independent** — supersedes the
  one-at-a-time rule. Five-part dependency test written into the constitution.
- **Decisions are provisional**: challenging a standing decision is now a DUTY
  of every seat, with an admissibility bar (new evidence or demonstrated
  consequence), an adversary pass for anything that loosens, and rejected
  challenges recorded.
- **The 200-name universe is FENCED** as a pre-instrument reference frame under
  the Clean Field Rule. It cannot be re-baselined — no point-in-time membership
  exists.
- **The gate's risk-free source**: a realised daily short-bill series; a
  constant is rejected. *(Execution Tier 3.)*
- **Market-closed work** is a registered trigger, not a schedule.
- **COO memo house format** specified: WHAT / WHY NOW / HOW / RECOMMENDATION,
  SWOT only when it earns its place, ranked by reversibility first.

### BUILT / SHIPPED

- **`## BINDS` protocol** — a seat names which OTHER seats a lesson binds; the
  chair carries it. Closes the propagation loop, which had a measured bias
  toward defects over anything that changes what gets proposed. First use was
  the mechanism's, carried to five seats unstruck.
- **Analytics capture confirmed on a real candidate**: store 37|0 → 40|3, six
  present legs each, `dropped_unmatched_days = 0` on all eighteen. Gate v5
  round 6 no longer runs in simulation. The Lab page now shows the three new
  rows beside three `not_captured` ones.
- Desk swept twice; the resolve pipeline is now a written six-step checklist in
  `co-cto.md` after the chair shipped work the CEO could not see.

### MEASURED

- **The machine, because the team had been treating local compute as scarce and
  the CEO challenged it.** He was right, and the bound is not the one being
  cited: **CPU is a Ryzen 9 7900X, 24 threads at 11% utilisation; the GPU is an
  RTX 4090, idle.** Neither is scarce. **RAM is the wall — 15.2 GB total, 0.8 GB
  free** — and `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONTAINERS = 6` is registered with basis
  `measured`, falsified-by *"a WinError 1455 or any host-memory kill"*. That
  limit came from a real out-of-memory event; it is a RAM limit wearing the word
  "container". **Three scarcities had been collapsing into one word: tokens
  (real, structural), RAM (real, 15.2 GB), CPU/GPU/wall-clock (not scarce, and
  where the false caution lived).** Worked example: the mechanism declined to
  recommend D5 without a cap on "12.6× compute" — but at the quant's measured
  12.8s per container that is ~27 minutes sequential on a machine at 11% CPU.
  Correction propagated to mechanism, quant, validator, analyst and builder.

- **Our price history carries a +43.84%/yr phantom factor** — today-anchored
  split adjustment (TENX reads $2,320 on 2020-06-01) plus **203 of 203 symbols
  alive today**. The walk-forward gate is structurally blind to it.
- **Gate v5 round 5: financing FIXED and unreopenable; the rule is NOT
  adoptable.** Discrimination **0.62, CI [0.53, 0.72] excluding 1.0** — the
  worst plausible null passes more often than a designed premia claim, and no
  margin from 1–8%/yr fixes it.
- **Two live v4.1 gate defects** (chair-verified in code): `breakeven_cost`
  interpolates on **total return**, so a cash-parking rule's robustness carries
  its T-bill yield — edge dies at 7.3 bps/side, gate reads 14.55 against a 10.0
  floor. And the OOS union is `(need+1)×4×hold`, so **a 1-day rule is certified
  on twenty trading days.**
- **Belt capacity is decided by an unseeded hash** when two symbols tie on fill
  count — a 16.7× swing on a gate criterion (`8c72939e`).
- **4 of 8 mechanism verdicts have died on the instrument, not the idea.**
- **A real premium found and deliberately not run**: month-end Treasury index
  extension, +1.63%/yr over 11 years, duration-ordered with a clean placebo —
  and the belt window contains +0.12%/yr of it. Zero containers spent.

### OPEN FOR FABLE

- **Tier-3 parked, in priority order**: the register's trigger-evaluability fix
  (**before** registering governance decisions — 17 of 19 triggers are inert
  and the endpoint reports `[]`); guard v1.3's server-issued echo; risk-limits
  and trading-resume onto the approval channel; the rebase direction fix **as a
  pair**; D5 and D7.
- **Three challenges filed under the new rule.** #1 (chair's) refuted in
  evidence by the COO. #2 (COO's) accepted — the constitution was amended the
  same day. #3 (COO's) and the mechanism's are **on the CEO's desk**: must the
  premia criterion be a gate statistic at all, and should the 10-year backfill
  be decoupled from gate v5?
- **Chair errors, all self-reported and in the queue**: resolving against
  8-character id prefixes (six inert events on the append-only log); shipping
  R19 without recording the run, so the CEO could not see it; splitting a
  cross-repo diff and stripping a UI caller of its spine callee.
- **`USE_FAKE_FIRESTORE` controls order routing, not just the ledger** — and
  this chair flipped it. `fund.py:132-140` carries a docstring saying
  `_real_broker()` exists to prevent exactly that conflation. Filed
  `b72847bc`.
